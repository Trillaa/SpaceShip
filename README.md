# SpaceStation
Space Station is a C++ program that applies a random number generator to create a
number of broken parts in multiple spaceships which are then taken to an empty bay in order to be repaired.
This program demonstrates the utilization of priority queues, vectors, inheritance, and
multiple types of distribution (poisson, normal, uniform).
